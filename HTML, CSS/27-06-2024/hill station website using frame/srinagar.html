    <p>Srinagar city is tucked in the heart of the Kashmir Valley and is the largest city. It is a beautiful hill station in India that lies on the banks of the Jhelum River. The travel highlights of this city are its natural environment, lush green gardens, and traditional houseboats that sail on the pristine lakes. Due to its strategic location in the Kashmir Valley, Srinagar is often compared to India's own Switzerland. 

        Here, winters and summers have their distinct charms. A sheet of thick ice wraps the valleys in winter. But, at the same time, summer is the time when valleys get drenched in lush greenery, giving shutterbugs enough moments to fantasize about their photography passion. Due to this distinct feature, every traveler loves to book the Jammu and Kashmir tour package.</p>
