    <h1>MANALI</h1>
    <img src="manali.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>Kullu and Manali are both different attractions in Himachal Pradesh. However, their names are taken together most of the time. Ever thought about why it is so? Well, it is because Kullu is the first town that comes when visiting Manali via road. Plus, if someone intends to visit Manali via air, they obviously need to arrive at Bhuntar airport in Kullu Valley. The proximity of Kullu to Manali is 41 kilometers (approx.), and that is another reason why people consider Kullu and Manali the same destination. To be more specific, Manali lies in the Northern end of Kullu Valley, while Kulli is the entry point to Manali. Both the hill resort towns experience snowfall at its best between November to February.

        Kullu is an open green sprawling valley stretched amidst the snow-kissed Himalayas whose average elevation is 1,279 m (approx.). This open-air valley is flanked by the green hills covered with deodar, pine, and oak trees from all sides. Tourism in Kullu Valley is all about ancient temples and several trekking trails that start from Kullu. In addition, there are several camping points, and the major highlight of Kullu tourism is River Beas which meanders through the valley and is best for river rafting.</p>
